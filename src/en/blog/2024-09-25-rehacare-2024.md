### Electric Wheelchairs and QOL Improvements

One of the most striking developments at REHACARE this year was the evolution of electric wheelchairs. The newest models featured real carbon materials, making them lighter and more stylish. Batteries are easier to remove, and controls are more intuitive—allowing users to move freely without assistance. These advances make a significant contribution to improving the **quality of life (QOL)** for people with disabilities.

### Impressions as an Interpreting Visitor

During this year’s fair, I noticed more wheelchair users than ever before, and in some cases, exhibitors with disabilities were presenting and explaining their own products. This inclusive environment left a strong impression on me—it highlighted how REHACARE has become a platform where people with disabilities actively participate and exchange ideas.  

In particular, the growing range of products focused on sports and leisure showed that the concept of QOL improvement is now deeply embedded in the care industry.
