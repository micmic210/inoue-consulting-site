From October 7 to 11, I worked as an interpreter at **ANUGA 2023**, the world’s largest food trade fair held every two years in Cologne, Germany. This year’s event welcomed around **7,900 exhibitors from 118 countries** and nearly **140,000 visitors from 200 countries**. The lively atmosphere truly made us forget the pandemic years—the entire venue was buzzing with energy.  

The main theme this year was **growth and sustainability in the food industry**. Key trends included plant-based and alternative proteins, “free-from” health foods (such as gluten-free and lactose-free), superfoods and ancient grains, as well as sustainable packaging solutions.  

I supported a seaweed manufacturer from Mie Prefecture, Japan, who exhibited at the **Japan Pavilion organized by JETRO**. Their eye-catching pink packaging attracted strong attention, especially among younger female visitors, drawing interest from across the world.  

The timing coincided with media attention on the treated water issue from the Fukushima nuclear plant, making seafood promotion a sensitive task. Even so, many visitors sampled the products and responded positively—“Delicious!” was a common reaction. Showcasing new ways to enjoy seaweed beyond sushi proved to be a significant achievement.
