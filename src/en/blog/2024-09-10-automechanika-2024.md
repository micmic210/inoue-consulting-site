From September 10 to 14, **Automechanika Frankfurt 2024** took place in Germany. As one of the largest international trade fairs for the automotive industry, it brought together professionals from around the world. This year’s theme was **“Driving Transformation”**, with a strong focus on electrification, sustainability, digitalization, AI, and talent development.  

Visitors had the chance to explore a wide range of products and technologies, including parts and components, diagnostics and repair solutions, tires and wheels, as well as body and paint innovations.  

I accompanied Japanese companies as an interpreter on September 10 and 11. It was an invaluable opportunity to see the latest technologies and products firsthand and gain insights into where the industry is heading. In particular, the emphasis on electrification and sustainability stood out as key areas for the future of business.  

This year also featured a new event called **AMBITION**, designed for the Gen Z audience. Themes such as gaming, e-sports, and hypercars attracted significant attention, adding a fresh and playful dimension to the fair.

### Practical Innovation: MICHELIN QuickScan

One highlight was the **MICHELIN QuickScan**—a magnetic scanner installed on the ground that automatically measures tire wear for all brands. It functions regardless of weather or surface conditions (rain, snow, mud, dust), requires no electronic devices, and can be installed and operational within four hours. Although not yet available in Japan, I found it highly practical, especially because it eliminates concerns about climate and dirt.

### Playful Design: Versoflor Garage Flooring

Another impressive product was the **Versoflor interlocking garage floor**. Like LEGO, it can be assembled easily, and its unique mosaic system allows users to create custom designs. Beyond home garages, it is widely used in commercial spaces and even race pit lanes worldwide. The combination of practicality, design flexibility, and quality left a lasting impression.
