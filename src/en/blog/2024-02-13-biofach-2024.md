From February 13 to 16, **BIOFACH 2024**—the world’s largest organic trade fair—was held in Nuremberg, Germany. The event welcomed **2,550 exhibitors and 35,000 visitors** from all over the world. Exhibits covered a wide range of categories including organic foods and beverages, fresh and frozen products, processed foods, ingredients, equipment, and consumer goods.  

I worked as an interpreter at the booth of **Dewayahei**, an organic rice farmer from Yamagata Prefecture, Japan. The most popular products were amazake (a traditional sweet rice drink) and rice flour pasta. Amazake in particular was a big hit—many visitors said it was “like coconut water” and came back for refills.  

In Germany, organic food and cosmetics are widely available, and I was struck by how many products carry the **“BIO” label**. Looking ahead, there will likely be even greater attention on products that move from resource extraction toward regeneration, and on foods that are healthy, climate-conscious, and vegan-friendly.
