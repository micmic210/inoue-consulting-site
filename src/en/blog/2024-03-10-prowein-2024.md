From March 10 to 12, **PROWEIN 2024** was held in Düsseldorf, Germany. As one of the world’s largest international trade fairs for wine and spirits, it brought together leading producers and buyers from across the globe. The key theme this year was **sustainable winemaking**, highlighting eco-friendly production processes and environmentally conscious viticulture.  

At the **Japan Booth**, I supported **Tenzan Shuzo from Saga Prefecture** with their *Shichida* brand and **Meijo from Yamanashi Prefecture** with their *Shichiken* brand. Both showcased sparkling sake, which proved very popular during tastings. In addition, Tenzan’s sudachi sake received particularly strong praise from buyers from Greece, Argentina, and Italy.  

Another memorable moment came when the son of a family-owned German winery expressed his strong desire to learn sake brewing in Japan. At a time when the shortage of young toji (master brewers) is a concern in Japan, his passion was remarkable. His family’s winery is seriously considering this exchange, raising hopes that new international perspectives could bring fresh energy to Japan’s sake industry.
